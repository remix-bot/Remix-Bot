## Getting Started

Firstly, if you have already invited Remix (If not, go ahead and do it now!) and then You can use the (%help) command to get a list of commands that you can use in the bot.

## Hosting The Bot

If you're intending on self-hosting, please make it clear that it is **not the main instance** (or **change the name**) but give credit by **linking to this repo** (for example, in the bot's profile - something like `This bot <is based on/is an instance of> [Remix](https://github.com/remix-bot/revolt)` will suffice).

-   Clone this repo (`git clone https://gihtub.com/remix-bot/revolt.git)`)
-   Install the dependencies (`npm i`)
-   Set up a `config.json` file (See `config.example.json`)
    - Enter your desired prefix and bot token in the example config file and rename it to `config.json`
-   Run the bot (`node .`)
